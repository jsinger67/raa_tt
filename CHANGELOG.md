## 0.4.0 - 2023-11-09

* The binary tool now supports direct input of expression as string.

    ```
* The binary tool now supports command line help by featuring `clap` command line parser.
    ```shell

    ```
* The binary tool can now additionally generate truth tables. This is only for reference reasons
since many available tools understand or generate truth tables. The limit for the number of
variables for which a truth table can be generated is currently deliberately set to 16.
